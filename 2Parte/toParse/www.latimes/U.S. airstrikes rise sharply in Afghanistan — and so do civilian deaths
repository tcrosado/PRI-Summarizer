In the case of the blast in Nangarhar province in August, U.S. officials have continued to assert that the American airstrike that day struck only militants.

It was the roadside bomb that resulted “in multiple enemy-caused civilian casualties,” said Navy Capt. Tom Gresback, a spokesman for coalition forces in Kabul.

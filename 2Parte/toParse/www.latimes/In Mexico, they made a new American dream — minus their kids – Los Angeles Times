Life inside the U.S. has also taken a darker turn for immigrants in the country illegally, and those in Texas have felt it keenly. Legislators in Austin, inspired by Trumpâ€™s tough talk on immigration, passed a bill that permits police officers to question a suspect's immigration status. Parts of the law have been blocked by a federal court, but Danny, a U.S. citizen, says he has felt a more general change. Some white Americans seem to regard him differently, he said, including one neighbor who has started calling the police when he and his cousin spend days fixing their cars in their yard.
